DESCRIPTION
This utility will prepare jobs (*.kjb) and transformations (*.ktr) for importing into the Data Flow Manager
by adding the following property to them:

<extended_description>#dataflow</extended_description>

Normally a user would accomplish this by editing the job or transformation in PDI. This utility will update
those files without the need for editing each one by one.

REQUIREMENTS
Java Runtime Environment or Java Developers Kit version 1.8.0 or newer installed.

Running the utility:
To start the utility on Windows execute the "importer-utility.bat" batch file.
To start the utility on Linux/Mac execute the "importer-utility.sh" script.

USAGE
**** It is highly suggested to create a back up of the jobs and transformations beforehand.

Only valid ktr and kjb files with valid XML format can be prepared by the utility.

Individual jobs or transformations can be added by clicking the + button in the toolbar and browsing to their
respective locations, folders can also be selected and all ktr and kjb files contained in them and in their
sub folders will also be added.

All files can be removed at once by clicking the << button in the tool bar or single/multiple selected files
can be removed by clicking the < button.

Once the files to be prepared have been added simply click the "process files button" with the "play" icon at
the bottom. Results will be displayed in the log showing which files were successfully updated and which once
had errors while getting processed.
